# Airdrop Snapshot

In this folder you will find information about the airdrop! You can find your balance and estimate airdrop amounts in each json file.
You can also see your joint airdrop amount in [airdrop.json](airdrop.json).

Since there are still a few weeks left until the airdrop, the expected amount is slightly more than the estimated amount shown here due to the few rebases left to accrue before the airdrop is distributed.

You can find the initial information announced and shared on [our old docs](https://docs.maiadao.xyz/products/hermes-protocol#birth-of-hermes-initial-supply-distribution).

## Decimals

sMaia has 9 decimals, so balances need to be divided by 1e9 to get the actual amount of sMAIA.

LPs and bHermes have 18 decimals, so balances need to be divided by 1e18 to get the actual amount of LPs and bHermes.

LPs USD value has 6 decimals, so the value of LPs needs to be divided by 1e6 to get the actual value in USD.
